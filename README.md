This repository contains code accompanying the paper "Deep learning of diffeomorphisms for optimal reparametrizations
of shapes" by Celledoni, Gl√∂ckner, Riseth, Schmeding. The figures from the paper may be seen and created from the notebooks:
1. [Curve Reparametrization](notebooks/curves-reparametrization.ipynb)
2. [Surface Reparametrization](notebooks/surfaces-reparametrization.ipynb)
3. [MNIST Digit Matching](notebooks/digit-matching.ipynb)
4. [Norm Estimates](notebooks/norm-estimates.ipynb)

## Setup
We only provide instructions for replicating the enironment using `conda`. This may be done by
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To install the source code from `funcshape` as  a library:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
The '-e' is optional and allows you to change the library after installation. Mainly intended for people intending further development. 


### MNIST Data
The image data from the hand-written digits are the ones used in 

Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio and P. Haffner: Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278-2324, November 1998, \cite{lecun-98}. 

The image data may be downloaded by running
```bash
./download-mnist.sh
```

## Contents
The main part of the source code is defined within the `funcshape`  folder. The folder contains the following modules:
* **layers**
    - **layerbase.py**: Defines an abstract base-class to be extended with new layertypes.
    - **sineseries.py**: Defines a pytorch module/layer for reparametrization of *curves*, using sine series.
    - **sinefourier.py**: Defines a pytorch module/layer for reparametrization of *surfaces*, using basis functions created as a tensor product of sine-series in one direction, and a full Fourier series in the other.
* **testlib**:
    * **curves.py**: Library of parametric curves and one-dimensional diffeomorphisms.
    * **surfaces.py**: Library of parametric surfaces and two-dimensional diffeomorphisms.
* **curve.py**: Class for defining multidimensional curves with a few helper functions.
* **derivatives.py**: Contains numerical approximations of derivatives, jacobians and other related functions.
* **diffeomorphism.py**: Contains classes for defining diffeomorphisms for both curves and surfaces.
* **gradient_descent.py**: Implements the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm for reparametrization of curves.
* **imageinterp.py**: Implements functions for creating parametric surfaces from image data.
* **interpolation.py**: Implements functions for interpolating between different curves and surfaces.
* **logging.py**: Immplements a Logging-class which is used to adjust verbosity of error logging while training the network.
* **loss.py**: Implements loss functions for curves and surfaces.
* **networks.py**: Implements a pytorch-module to collect layers into a neural network.
* **reparametrize.py**: Implements the reparametrization algorithm. Defines a single interface, which optionally calls a function to be used with torch's LBFGS-optimizer.
* **surface.py**: Implements a surface class, with various helper functions.
* **transforms.py**: Implements curve/surface transforms such as the *SRVT* or *Qmap*.
* **utils.py**: Contains various helper functions.
* **visual.py**: Defines functions for easier plotting and visualization.
